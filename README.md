# MindSpark

MindSpark is an open-source **mind-mapping app you actually own** — no accounts, no paywalls, no feature gates, no usage limits. Self-host it in one command, run it free in the browser with every map saved to your *own* private GitHub repo, or add one small Cloudflare Worker to unlock real-time sharing and collaboration. It's vanilla JavaScript with **zero runtime dependencies**, MIT-licensed, AI-assisted, and yours to run, modify, and extend.

**▶ Try it live → [mindspark.githubpage.workers.dev](https://mindspark.githubpage.workers.dev/)** — runs entirely in your browser. Sign in with GitHub and your maps are saved as private JSON files in a `mindspark-maps` repo on your own account (no server in between).

**🧠 Make maps by chatting → [MindSpark — Mind Map for Everyone](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6a3a81242f748191ab1b7cff99a21619-mindspark-mind-map-for-everyone)** — describe a topic and the GPT builds the map, then hands you a link to open and edit it in MindSpark. No account needed to view.

## Features

Everything below the "Collaboration" heading needs the optional cloud worker; everything above it works fully offline / self-hosted with no account. See **[Local vs cloud](#what-works-offline-vs-what-needs-the-cloud)** for the exact split.

**Editing & canvas** (always local)

- **Infinite canvas** with smooth pan & zoom, fit-to-screen, and a minimap
- **Keyboard-first editing** — `Tab` for child, `Enter` for sibling, `F2` to rename, `Del` to remove, start typing to edit
- **Live auto-layout** — the tree tidies itself as you type, so a growing node never overlaps its neighbours
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** — drop a topic on another's centre to nest it, or on its top/bottom edge to insert it between siblings and reorder
- **Layout options** — Balanced (split left/right), Right, Left, or Down (org-chart)
- **Incremental collapse / expand** — one branch depth per click, either per-node or across the whole map at once (cycles fully-open ↔ fully-closed, reporting progress as it goes)
- **Touch support** — pan, pinch-zoom, drag and select on phones and tablets
- **Math** — write `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (display) LaTeX and it renders as native **MathML**; equations also render in PNG exports. Zero dependencies — covers the common inline subset (sub/superscripts, Greek, operators, `\frac`, `\sqrt`, accents, fonts, function names)
- **Node formulas** — a small Excel-like formula engine lives inside nodes: `SUM(children)`, `AVERAGE`, `MIN`/`MAX`, `IF`, `ROUND`, `SQRT`, and more, with autocomplete as you type. Turns a branch of numbers into a live-computed rollup instead of static text
- **Version history** — browse, **diff** (added / removed / edited nodes), preview, and restore past versions
- **Rich text & nodes** — bold/italic/underline/strikethrough, highlight & text colour, font size, alignment, bulleted/numbered lists (including multi-line lists inside a single node), links, notes, images, citations, task progress
- **Color themes** — 10 built in (Light, Dark, Dracula, Catppuccin Light/Dark, Rosé Pine Moon/Dawn, Nord, GitHub Light/Dark), set per node or per map
- **Undo / redo** (full history) · **search & highlight** · **presentation mode**
- **Multiple maps** with a clickable sidebar; create, rename, duplicate, delete
- **Import** JSON, OPML, Markdown, GitMind (`.gmind`) and MindMeister (`.mind`) files
- **Export** to PNG, PDF, JSON, Markdown/text, Word (`.doc`), Mermaid, a references list, or a prompt
- **Read-only share links** — *Copy share link* gzip-encodes the **entire map into a `#view=` URL**; anyone can open it without an account or server, then save an editable copy into their own MindSpark
- **Persistence** — SQLite when self-hosted, or your own private GitHub repo in cloud mode

**Markdown ⇄ Mind map** (always local)

Every map *is* a Markdown outline — not a one-way export bolted on afterward. Toggle **Markdown mode** (`</>`) and edit either side; they stay in sync live, in both directions.

- **Split-pane text editor** with a line-numbered gutter, real syntax highlighting, and autocomplete for Markdown/formula syntax as you type
- **Fold / unfold** any branch independently — including the map's own metadata comment at the top of the file — so you can work on one section of a long outline at a time
- **Word wrap** toggle for long lines, with the gutter staying correctly aligned either way
- **Click to jump** — click a line in the text and its node is selected on the canvas, or select a node and its line is revealed and scrolled into view (unfolding ancestors as needed)
- **Live rendered preview** toggle, and **download that preview as a PDF** directly from the editor
- **Formatting round-trips as real Markdown/HTML**, not flattened to plain text — bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight, text colour, font size, alignment, bulleted/numbered lists, and inline code all survive a round trip through the text and back
- Paste or type a Markdown outline straight into a node or the editor and it becomes real structure — headings become branches, `` `inline code` `` renders as code, fenced blocks and tables carry through

**Built for researchers & engineers** (always local)

- **Citations with DOI autofill** — open the citation form on any node, paste a DOI, and MindSpark fetches authors/title/year/venue from **Crossref** automatically. Cited nodes get a reference marker and roll up into **Export → References list**
- **Compile subtree → prompt** — assemble any branch into a structured prompt, substitute `{{variables}}`, see a live token estimate, then copy it or **run it directly against Anthropic or OpenAI** with your own API key, right from the map
- **Prompt-engineering templates** — Role/Task/Context/Constraints/Examples, Chain-of-Thought, Function-calling schema, Few-shot examples
- **Research templates** — IMRaD research paper, literature review synthesis, research proposal, experiment design, systematic review (PRISMA), research question (FINER), thesis / multi-paper arc, conference talk outline, reviewer response / rebuttal
- **AI & agent templates** — AI Agent Architecture, Agentic Workflow Patterns, and a Claude **Agent Skill** scaffold (a ready-made `SKILL.md` with frontmatter)
- **Software-engineering templates** — system architecture, design doc / RFC, Domain-Driven Design, sprint / feature plan, incident post-mortem
- **50+ built-in templates** in total, spanning research, prompt engineering, AI/agents, software, product, design, study, writing, career, and project management — browse them from **+ Topic ▾**

**Collaboration** ☁ *(needs the cloud worker — see [below](#cloud--collaboration-deployment))*

- **Sign in with GitHub** — one-click OAuth (the static build also supports a personal-access-token login with no worker)
- **Cloud share (editable)** — publish a map to a shared `#shared=` room and copy an edit link collaborators can open and save to
- **Real-time collaboration** — multiple people editing the same shared map, with automatic merge
- **Identity-based access control** — add named collaborators with **editor / viewer** roles, set per-link access (**view / edit**, optionally **sign-in required**), and **revoke** access at any time
- **Shared-maps sidebar** — one place for maps *shared by you* and *shared with you*, with relationship badges
- **Recently opened by** — see which signed-in collaborators have opened a shared map

## What makes MindSpark different

- **A Markdown file, not a proprietary format.** Most mind-mapping tools treat Markdown as a one-way export. Here it's the *native* format in both directions — the canvas and the text editor are two views of the same document, live-synced, so you can drop into a text editor for fast bulk edits and still get a proper diagram back.
- **You own the data.** No required account. Self-host with one command (`node server.js`, SQLite, zero setup) or run the static build for **$0 forever**, with every map saved as a plain JSON file in *your own* private GitHub repo — never on a vendor's server you don't control.
- **No feature gates, ever.** Real-time collaboration, unlimited maps and nodes, full version history with diffs, every export format — none of it is paywalled or capped, self-hosted or cloud.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The canvas, the LaTeX math rendering, the formula engine, the Markdown parser — all hand-written vanilla JavaScript. Nothing to `npm install`, a minimal supply-chain surface, and the whole editor is one file you can actually read.
- **Computation inside a mind map.** A built-in formula engine (`SUM(children)`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`, …) with autocomplete — most mind-mapping tools treat every node as inert text; here a branch of numbers can compute a live rollup.
- **A bridge to LLM workflows, not just a diagram.** Compile any branch into a prompt with a token estimate, substitute `{{variables}}`, and run it against Anthropic or OpenAI directly from the map — plus dedicated templates for prompt engineering (Chain-of-Thought, few-shot, function-calling schemas) and agent design (including a Claude Agent Skill scaffold).
- **Purpose-built for research writing**, not just business templates — IMRaD papers, PRISMA systematic reviews, FINER research questions, literature reviews — with citation management (DOI → Crossref autofill, a formatted references export) built directly into node editing.

## What works offline vs. what needs the cloud

MindSpark's editor is 100% client-side. The only things that require the optional Cloudflare Worker are the ones that inherently need a shared server between people.

| Capability | Local (self-host or static + GitHub) | Cloud (worker) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Create / edit maps, all layouts, math, formulas, prompt building | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Markdown mode** (two-way sync, preview, PDF export), citations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Import / export (JSON, OPML, Markdown, PNG, PDF, `.doc`, Mermaid, …) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Version history, undo/redo, search, presentation mode | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Read-only share links** (`#view=`, whole map encoded in the URL) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Save maps to **your own private GitHub repo** | ✅ *(sign in with a token)* | ✅ |
| One-click **"Sign in with GitHub"** (OAuth) | ➖ *(token login only)* | ✅ |
| **Cloud share (editable)** `#shared=` links | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Real-time collaboration** / live merge | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Access control** (named collaborators, roles, revoke, link modes) | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Shared-maps sidebar**, "recently opened by" | ❌ | ✅ |
| **GPT map-import** endpoint (`POST /api/import`) | ❌ | ✅ *(recipients still open a local `#view=` link)* |

Notes:

- Collaboration is only offered in **cloud mode** (static build + a configured worker). The single-user `node server.js` / SQLite deployment intentionally has no shared backend, so it offers local maps and `#view=` links but not `#shared=` collaboration.
- The two share links are different by design: **`#view=`** carries the whole map in the URL and needs nothing server-side (read-only); **`#shared=`** points to a live room in the worker and supports editing, collaboration, and access control.
- **Access control** (JWT-signed identities, roles, revoke) additionally requires the worker's `AUTH_SECRET` to be set. Without it the worker returns `501` for identity and the app falls back to legacy capability links.

## Creating a map

Press **`Tab`** to add a child topic and **`Enter`** to add a sibling — the tree auto-arranges into a balanced layout as you go. New sign-ins start with the **“ML - Overview (Demo)”** sample above so there's something to explore right away.

## Make maps with AI — the MindSpark GPT

**[MindSpark — Mind Map for Everyone](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6a3a81242f748191ab1b7cff99a21619-mindspark-mind-map-for-everyone)** is a Custom GPT that builds maps for you. Describe a topic, outline, or paste some notes — it generates a structured map (branches, bullets, sticky notes, checklists, citations) and returns a link.

The link opens the map **read-only** in MindSpark (no account needed to view). Click **"Make an editable copy"** to save it into your own workspace — your repo, your token, nothing stored on anyone else's server.

**How it works:** the GPT calls a small endpoint, `POST /api/import`, which turns the map spec into the same gzip-encoded `#view=` share link the *Copy share link* feature produces. No personal access token and no repo writes are involved, so it works for every user. The endpoint lives in the optional Cloudflare Worker under [`worker/`](worker/) — see [`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md) to self-host it, along with the OpenAPI Action schema and map JSON schema for wiring up your own Custom GPT.

## Quick start (self-hosted)

Requires **Node.js ≥ 22** (for the built-in SQLite + HTTP — no packages to install).

```bash
node server.js
# → http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. No build step, no `npm install`, no native compilation. A SQLite database file is created automatically at `./data/mindspark.db`.

Optionally, via npm (just runs the same command, but silences the experimental-SQLite notice):

```bash
npm start
```

### Configuration

All optional, set as environment variables:

| Variable  | Default                  | Description                |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| `PORT`    | `3000`                   | HTTP port                  |
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/mindspark.db`    | SQLite database file path  |
| `PUBLIC`  | `./public`               | Static frontend directory  |

```bash
PORT=8080 DB_PATH=/var/lib/mindspark/db.sqlite node server.js
```

## Deployment modes

MindSpark detects how it's running and picks a storage backend automatically (the client probes `/healthz` at boot — if it answers, it's the self-hosted server; otherwise it's GitHub-backed cloud mode).

| Mode | How to run | Auth | Storage | Collaboration | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|:---:|---|
| **Self-hosted** | `node server.js` | None — single user | SQLite on disk | ❌ | Your server |
| **Cloud (static)** | Host `public/` on any static host | GitHub token | User's own private `mindspark-maps` repo | ➖ *(add worker)* | **$0** |
| **Cloud (worker)** | `public/` on Cloudflare Workers **+** the `worker/` collab worker | GitHub OAuth / token | User's GitHub repo + shared rooms in the worker | ✅ | **$0** on CF free tier |

### Cloud (static-only) deployment — $0 forever

Pure browser app, talks directly to the GitHub API. Each visitor stores their own maps in their own private repository. **No backend to maintain.**

- **GitHub Pages** — the repo ships a workflow at [`.github/workflows/static.yml`](.github/workflows/static.yml) that publishes `public/` on every push to `main`. (Or set **Settings → Pages** to deploy the `/public` folder from your branch.)
- **Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / Vercel** — point any static host at `public/`. No build command, output directory `public`.

**User flow (per visitor):** click *Create a personal access token on GitHub →*, generate a `repo`-scoped token, paste it in, and sign in. On first sign-in MindSpark creates a **private** `mindspark-maps` repo and commits a small JSON file per save. The token is kept only in `localStorage` and sent only to `api.github.com`. Revoke at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.

### Cloud + collaboration deployment

This is how the live demo runs: the `public/` app is served as a **Cloudflare Worker with static assets** (see [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc)), paired with the **collaboration/OAuth worker** in [`worker/`](worker/).

```bash
# 1) Deploy the app (public/) as a Cloudflare Worker
npx wrangler deploy                                   # uses wrangler.jsonc

# 2) Deploy the collaboration + OAuth worker (Durable Objects live here)
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml

# 3) Set the worker secrets (enables OAuth, sharing, and access control)
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID   --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET --config worker/wrangler.toml
npx wrangler secret put AUTH_SECRET        --config worker/wrangler.toml   # required for identity-based access control
# npx wrangler secret put IMPORT_TOKEN     --config worker/wrangler.toml   # only if using the GPT /api/import flow
```

Then set `GH_OAUTH.workerUrl` (and `clientId`) in `public/app.js` to your worker's URL. If you skip the worker entirely and leave `GH_OAUTH` blank, only the token login shows and collaboration is hidden — everything else keeps working. See [`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md) for the OAuth App setup and the GPT Action schema.

> The app and the worker are **two separate deploys**. `npx wrangler deploy` ships the app (`public/`); `npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml` ships the collab/OAuth worker. Set worker secrets against the worker config, as shown above.

### Self-hosted (VPS / Docker)

```bash
git clone <your-repo> mindspark && cd mindspark
PORT=80 node server.js        # put nginx/Caddy in front for TLS

# or Docker:
docker build -t mindspark .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v mindspark-data:/app/data mindspark
```

Keep it running with systemd/pm2. Sample unit:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /opt/mindspark/server.js
Environment=PORT=3000
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory=/opt/mindspark
```

## REST API (self-hosted server)

A plain REST API — build other clients, scripts, or integrations on top of it.

| Method   | Path             | Description                          |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/maps`      | List all maps (id, title, color)     |
| `GET`    | `/api/maps/:id`  | Get one full map (nodes + structure) |
| `POST`   | `/api/maps`      | Create a map (body = map JSON)       |
| `PUT`    | `/api/maps/:id`  | Update / upsert a map                |
| `DELETE` | `/api/maps/:id`  | Delete a map                         |
| `GET`    | `/healthz`       | Health check                         |

The collaboration worker exposes a separate `/api/collab/*` surface (shared-map read/write, access-control list, link modes) plus `/api/session` (mint a signed identity) and `/api/import` (GPT map import). Those are documented in [`worker/README.md`](worker/README.md).

A "map" is JSON shaped like:

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "title": "My Map",
  "color": "#e0613a",
  "rootId": "r1",
  "nodes": {
    "r1": { "id": "r1", "text": "Central Idea", "parent": null, "x": 0, "y": 0, "side": "root" },
    "n2": { "id": "n2", "text": "Branch",       "parent": "r1", "side": "right", "color": "#dcefce" }
  }
}
```

### Using a different database

The data layer lives entirely in `server.js` (the `Q` prepared statements and `upsert()` helper). To switch to **PostgreSQL / MySQL**, replace those with your driver's queries — the table is just `(id, title, color, data, updated)` where `data` is the full map JSON. Nothing else in the app needs to change.

## Roadmap — what's next

Contributions welcome (see the issue templates under **New issue**). Ideas on the list:

- **Cross-device shared-maps sidebar.** The "shared by me / with me" list is currently per-browser (localStorage). Now that sign-in provides a stable identity, sync it per-user so the same list follows you across devices.
- **Unify access control across channels.** Bring the real-time collaboration channel under the same identity-based access model as the HTTP sync, so roles and revoke apply everywhere consistently.
- **"The room is the map."** Optionally make a shared room the single source of truth (Overleaf-style) so the owner doesn't keep a separate copy that can drift.
- **Upgrade legacy share links.** A one-click re-publish to move older anonymous capability links onto identity-gated access.
- **Collaboration for self-hosters.** An optional path to run the collaboration backend alongside `node server.js`, so self-hosted instances can share too.
- **Docs.** Expand `worker/README.md` with the full `/api/collab/*` and access-control reference.
- **Mobile polish.** Continue hardening touch/gesture handling and small-screen layout.

### Repo housekeeping (good first tasks)

- Add contributor docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and a pull-request template.
- The issue-template chooser links to **Discussions** — enable Discussions (Settings → Features) or update the links in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`.
