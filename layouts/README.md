# Layout presets

Each file here is a complete MindSpark layout, expressed as JSON. To use one:
open the theme panel (🎨), find **Layout**, scroll to the **Import** tile, and
paste the file's contents.

Imported layouts are saved on your device. The maps you apply them to are not
affected — a map records the resolved strategy and parameters, so a map using
a layout you imported still renders correctly for someone who has never seen
it.

## Why these are data, not code

A layout picks one of the four placement **strategies** MindSpark implements
and tunes it. It cannot define a new algorithm, and that is deliberate: a
layout travels inside every `#view=` share link, so anything executable here
would run on the machine of whoever opened a shared map.

| Strategy | Shape | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `tree`   | Branches growing from a root | `axis`, `dir`, `split`, `rootAnchor` |
| `chain`  | A sequence along an axis with sub-trees hanging off | `axis`, `dir`, `alternate`, `start`, `stem` |
| `radial` | Root at the centre, depth as distance | `ring`, `startAngle`, `sweep` |
| `grid`   | Top-level topics as cards, sub-trees as outlines | `columns`, `indent` |
| `matrix` | Columns with rows aligned across them, like a table | `colGap`, `rowGap`, `cellGap` |

`chain` also takes an `angle`: 90 is square to the spine (a timeline), and
anything less slants the ribs (a fishbone). Existing timelines are unaffected,
since 90 is the default.

Values outside the allowed range are clamped and unrecognised keys are ignored,
so a layout written against a newer version still loads — it just ignores what
it does not understand.

## Writing your own

The quickest route is to copy an existing map's layout: open the cog beside
**Layout** to see the current settings as JSON, adjust, then paste into the
Import dialog with an `id` and `name` added.

`id` must be letters, digits and dashes only; `name` is what appears in the
picker and is truncated past 24 characters.
